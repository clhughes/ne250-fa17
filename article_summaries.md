### Article #2
Energy Options Network, "What will advanced nuclear power plants cost?"

**Summary:**
This report aims to create a standardized method of reporting LCOE for advanced reactor technology based on data submitted anonymously by eight reactor start-up companies.
It then compares the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for advanced reactors with that of "conventional" reactors.
Additionally, it provides an overview of types of advanced reactor designs and features that will both raise and lower their cost when compared to conventional reactors.

**Pros:**
I thought this paper was exteremely interesting and clearly explained in layperson's terms the challenges and methodologies behind assessing LCOE.
This was especially interesting since we just discussed and calculated LCOE for an NE 267 assignment.

**Cons:**
It seemed to me that a major audience for this work would be investors, who should be interested in the cost projections presented by nuclear startups.
It would be interesting to know more about the costs of Gen IV reactor research and development, which I would assume would add an enormous up-front cost, as this process should be longer for advanced reactors.
I would also be interested in how companies project licensing costs, since there is no standardied process for licensing advanced reactors.
