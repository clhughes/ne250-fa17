### Article #5

**Summary:**
This article proposes a "deep-burn" transmuter to transmute the transuranic (TRU) component of LWR waste in "one pass" using a gas-cooled modular helium reactor.
The paper begins by describing the proliferation risks associated with nuclear waste (it's interesting to note that this paper was written in 2002, and the authors describe Yucca Mountain contemporaneously) and introducing the design concept.
There is discussion of using thermal neutrons for transmutation as well as the TRISO particle fuel.

**Pros:**
It's really great to see a paper considering safeguards during reactor design.
It's also interesting to see a paper practically consider transmutation (considering favorable cross sections, etc.) after reading Article #4, which provided a process for evaluating potential transmutation processes.

**Cons:**
This paper provides a good overview of the deep-burn concept and technology.
It would be interesting to see more detail about economics of this design and practical steps that would need to be taken to make this a reality as well as the authors' future plans for work on deep-burn transmutation.
It would also be interesting to see some discussion of the Np isotopes.


### Article #4

**Summary:**
This article describes a process by which transuranic or fission product transmutation can be used to produce fission products with short or long half lives or to transform toxic fission products into shorter-lived fission products.

**Pros:**
This paper address an important issue of clean spent nuclear fuel.
I think this work also has very interesting possibility for safeguards applications -- transmuting isotopes used to produce nuclear weapons into other isotopes.

**Cons:**
Pages three and four of the paper were dedicated to charts that (I thought) seemed illegible, especially electronically.
There was little reference to or explanation of the purpose of including these charts, which I think could have been more helpful if they had included annotations showing which decays were of most interest.

### Article #3

**Summary:**
This is a detailed overview article of MSR technology.
It begins with a list of operational and safety advantages of MSRs over solid fuel designs.
LeBlanc then describes the history and design of MSRs as well as the increasing interest in MSR technology and changing design criteria.

**Pros:**
This paper is a great resource for a crash course on MSRs.
The diagrams are extremely clear and helpful references for understanding how MSRs work.

**Cons:**
In discussing the advantages of MSRs over solid fuel designs, LeBlanc glosses over features (i.e. plating out noble and seminoble metals) that I don't believe are fully developed for actual construction.
I also think it's important to note that we don't have sufficient chlorine cross section data to model chloride salts.
This is something I feel that we in the reactor design community consistently overlook.

### Article #2
Energy Options Network, "What will advanced nuclear power plants cost?"

**Summary:**
This report aims to create a standardized method of reporting LCOE for advanced reactor technology based on data submitted anonymously by eight reactor start-up companies.
It then compares the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for advanced reactors with that of "conventional" reactors.
Additionally, it provides an overview of types of advanced reactor designs and features that will both raise and lower their cost when compared to conventional reactors.

**Pros:**
I thought this paper was exteremely interesting and clearly explained in layperson's terms the challenges and methodologies behind assessing LCOE.
This was especially interesting since we just discussed and calculated LCOE for an NE 267 assignment.

**Cons:**
It seemed to me that a major audience for this work would be investors, who should be interested in the cost projections presented by nuclear startups.
It would be interesting to know more about the costs of Gen IV reactor research and development, which I would assume would add an enormous up-front cost, as this process should be longer for advanced reactors.
I would also be interested in how companies project licensing costs, since there is no standardied process for licensing advanced reactors.
